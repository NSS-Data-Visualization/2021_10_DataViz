# Data Visualization Challenge, October 2021

This month, your challenge is to retrieve data from [APIzen.Date](https://apizen.date/), a simple API that can be used to fetch historical events into JSON format. For this challenge, you are welcome to use as much or as little data as you want to retrieve from the API to build a visualization.

This API returns three categories of events:
* Events: Significant historical events occurring on the input day.
* Births: Notable births from popular figures occurring on the input date.
* Deaths: Notable deaths from popular figures occurring on the input date.

See the [full documentation](https://premium.zenquotes.io/on-this-day-api-documentation/) for more information.

This month, you can be creative and decide what sort of question you want to try and answer with the data. Here are some ideas to get you started:
* Which dates have a large number of births or deaths?
* How do the types of events that occur differ across seasons?
* Who shares your birthday?
